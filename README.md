# TurtlebotMoveForward
A repository that contains the working poi_name_locator files and srv, as well as a program that moves the turtlebot to one requested location.

This repository does not contain any ROS packages so it cannot be run alone in a terminal (note the absence of the CMakeLists and package.xml files). The purpose of this repository is just to store the files, the files must be copied into another package in order to run.
